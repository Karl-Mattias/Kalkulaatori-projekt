Kalkulaatori-projekt
====================
For practice I made a calculator program with tkinker and pixboard.
It allows simple calculations with decimal numbers, displays numbers in both binary and decimal,
allows binary number imput and draws simple graphs when variables are inserted.

Feel free to investigate.
